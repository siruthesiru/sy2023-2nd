- required for candidates for graduation in all computing programs
- an opportunity for students to integrate the appropriate courses, knowledge, and competencies learned in the baccalaureate curriculum
- terminal project requirements that would not only demonstrate a student's comprehensive knowledge of the area of study and research methods
- Also allow them to apply the concepts and methods to a specific problem in their area of specialization
- Students are encouraged to produce innovative results, generate new knowledge or theories, or explore new frontiers of knowledge or application areas
- an underatking appropriate to a professional field - should significantly address an existing prolem or need
- Under the mentorship of competenet faculty
- focuses on infrastructure, application or processes involved in introducing a computing solution to a problem

### Grading System
- 50% requirements/deliverables
  - Meeting with capstone (Rubric 1) | 10%

  - Advisers sign, Panelsists sign, then Head signs
- Re Defense
  - Another formal capstone project proposal is necessary because the proponents failed to present his/her capstone proposal project properly and or the document is not properly stated
- Failed
  - The capstone project is not feasible as a capstone project. The verdict is a unanimous decision among the three members of the capstone defense panel. Once issued, it is final and irrevocable.
